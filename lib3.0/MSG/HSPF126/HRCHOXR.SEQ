 RCHRES: &I

 The calculated saturation dissolved oxygen concentration (SATDO) is
 negative.  This occurs when the water temperature is above 66 C (150 F).
 In most cases, this indicates an instability in advection or an error in 
 the time series input (GATMP if HTRCH is on, TW if HTRCH is off). Try
 changing the ADCALC activity flag (ADFG) to 2; this will cause the advection
 to use the same weighting factors as are used in the flow routing.

 Relevant values are :

      SATDO         TW
